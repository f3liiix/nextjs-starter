# Next.js Starter Template

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project starter, enhanced with modern tools and libraries to help developers quickly start Next.js development.

## Features

This starter template comes with several key features to accelerate your development process:

1. **Integrated UI Components**: Pre-configured with [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/) for beautiful, responsive UI components.
2. **Light/Dark Mode**: Integrated with [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes) for seamless theme switching.
3. **Local Fonts**: Uses locally hosted Inter fonts to avoid slow loading from Google Fonts, especially beneficial for regions with limited access to Google services.
4. **Code Formatting**: Uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for fast, consistent formatting and linting commands out of the box.

## Getting Started

First, Click `Use this template` to create your own repository,
then run the development server:

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
